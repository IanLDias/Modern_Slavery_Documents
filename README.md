# About

The UK Modern Slavery Act (MSA) requires companies above a certain valuation to report steps that they are taking to to abolish modern slavery from their operations. 

Australia has now also implemented a similar act. 

This consists of thousands of PDFs every year submitted by these companies.


# Goals

The goal of this project is to implement an information extraction framework for these PDFs and provide text summarization.
