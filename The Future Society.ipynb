    "\n",
    "#### General questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What past research has been done on these companies? Is there a valid source with its history towards slavery? Can we make a metric out of this?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Which businesses have a higher risk of slavery exploitation? Look at specific industry and as well locations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevant to the slavery statments\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What does the slavery statement focus on?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can do something simple and get TF-IDFs for each document. This will give the frequency of word counts for each document and how that relates to the other documents. Gives a broader picture of what the document is about. If a document deviates from the norm, this could raise questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) How effectively do they respond to the standard and practices required? Is the information relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can use the above to also answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Do they focus on future goals or things that they've already done?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can use a simple regex script to find tense. Can also use Named Entity Recognition to find more complex associations."
